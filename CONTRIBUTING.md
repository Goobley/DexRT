Overview
--------

We would love for you to get involved.
Please report any bugs encountered on the GitHub issue tracker.

If you are interested in adding a feature, please reach out, even if to say "I'm not sure if this is a good idea"!
We can then determine the best way to go about the feature, and whether it's already on the core roadmap.

We require all contributors to abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
